		<h1>Operating Block Management Tool,<br> Specialty Project for the Baccalaureate in Computer Science</h1>
	
		<p>	
			I developed this project with two classmates as part of the Computer Science and Digital Systems exam, my specialty for the baccalaureate.<br>
			It is a small suite of software for the management of the blocks of a surgical service in a clinic, from making the appointment to the patient's exit.
            We divided the process into three stages, each corresponding to a program: First, making the appointment, with a form to be filled out for the surgeon. Then the scheduling, with an automatic task scheduling engine (this part was studied but not completed) and a specially intuitive interface for the service secretary, through which he can rearrange and delete scheduled appointments. Finally, the follow-up of the act, with a very ergonomic interface designed for the block nurse to communicate the progress of the operation in real time (from entering the block to exiting and disinfecting the room) and a centralized display system inspired by train station information screens indicating the general activity status of the service. In addition, every operation is recorded in a register, with a number of details.<br>
			An interesting point is that we collaborated, for the drafting of the specifications for this project, with a clinic director who was looking for a similar solution.
